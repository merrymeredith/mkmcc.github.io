Of course, I should to give credit where it is due.  This site uses
the 
<a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Vollkorn">Vollkorn</a>, 
<a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/PT+Sans">PT Sans</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Inconsolata">Inconsolata</a>
typefaces hosted by the free
<a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts#HomePlace:home">Google WebFonts</a> service.

I wrote the most of the css for this site myself, but used the file "reset.css"
from an old version of the <a href="http://blueprintcss.org/">css blueprint</a>
project.  The rest was heavily inspired
by <a href="http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~beffara/">Emmanuel Beffara's</a> website and
bears an obvious resemblance.  The colors are taken from the
"<a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">solarized</a>" palette by Ethan
Schoonover.

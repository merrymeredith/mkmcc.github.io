This page aims to give a quick overview of the things I've worked on
in grad school.  If you want less detail, check out the "word cloud"
visualization of my papers above; if you want more detail, you can
browse my publications [here](../biblio/index.html).



Convection in Galaxy Clusters

The plasma in galaxy clusters is magnetized, weakly collisional, and
thermally conductive.  Together, these properties significantly
modify the physics of convection.  Though clusters had long been
assumed to be stable to convection, it now seems that the
intracluster plasma probably boils.

I've worked a bit on this convection, in particular toward
understanding the non-linear saturation of the convective
instabilities.  The net effect appears to be that magnetic field
lines wrap up near the centers of clusters, and that convection
drives turbulence in the outskirts.  The magnitude of these effects
is still uncertain, but it is probably a non-monotonic function of
mass.

Thermal Instability

I've also studied thermal instability in galaxy clusters.  Whether
or not the plasma in clusters is thermally unstable is a
surprisingly tricky question --- it depends on the unknown
"feedback" process heating the plasma.

Under the reasonable assumption that the plasma in clusters *is*
thermally unstable, however, the non-linear saturation turns out to
have an interesting result: the instability can only grow to large
amplitudes at special locations in the cluster.  This location
coincides with the "filaments" of cold gas seen in many clusters,
and it offers a quantitative explanation of the x-ray
luminosity-temperature relation.

Structure Formation and Cluster Outskirts

Somehow, clusters maintain their large-scale temperature gradients
in spite of thermal conduction and convection.

The work described in the poster to the right (and in
[this](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.432..404M) paper)
argues that the continued formation of clusters actually generates and
maintains this temperature gradient.  Measuring the properties of the
gas in clusters may thus directly constrain for formation histories of
clusters.

The paper also outlines a method for using the (known) scatter in
accretion histories to predict the (unknown) scatter in cluster
observables.  My collaborators and I are currently using this method
to better understand potential biases in some cosmological
measurements.

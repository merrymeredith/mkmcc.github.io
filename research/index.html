The hot plasma filling galaxy clusters is magnetized and thermally
conductive.  This means this gas is susceptible to two
recently-discovered instabilities known as the HBI and the MTI
(pictured to the left) &mdash; these instabilities are a lot like
normal convection, but they depend on <i>temperature</i> instead
of <i>entropy</i>.  This is very interesting, because the gas in
galaxy clusters is stable to the classical theory for convection, but
unstable to these new instabilities.  So, while clusters have long
been assumed to be convectively stable, it now seems that the
intracluster plasma might boil vigorously.  This boiling represents a
radical change in the dynamics of cluster gas and could affect the way
we interpret a range of observations of galaxy clusters.  For
example, convection efficiently mixes the gas and would distribute
metals more efficiently through the galaxy cluster.  Boiling also
drives turbulence, which influences the connection between gas
pressure and gravity used to infer the masses of clusters.
</p>

<p>
I studied these new forms of convection as part of my Ph.D. thesis; in
particular, I worked on understanding the differences between the HBI
and the MTI and on understanding non-linear saturation of the
convective instabilities.  Since the linear phases are so short-lived,
understanding the non-linear behavior of the instabilities is
essential for knowing their astrophysical implications.
</p>

<p>
The HBI, pictured below, turns out to be a fairly quiescent
instability.  As the instability grows, it reorients magnetic field
lines to be preferentially horizontal.  This <i>stabilizes</i> the gas
against the HBI, so the instability effectively shuts itself off
before it really develops.  We end up with a stable atmosphere,
without much turbulence, and with very horizontal magnetic field
lines.  This happens when the temperature increases with radius, as in
the centers of cool-core galaxy clusters.

<p>
The MTI occurs in the outer parts of galaxy clusters, where the
temperature declines with radius.  In many ways, this instability is
similar to the HBI: it creates buoyant plumes which rake out the
magnetic field lines, reorienting an initially horizontal field to
become predominantly vertical.  This is where the similarity with the
HBI stops, however: while vertical field lines are linearly stable to
the MTI, they are <i>non-linearly unstable</i> (i.e., they become
unstable if given a big enough push).  So the MTI can&rsquo;t shut
itself off as efficiently as the HBI; it continues to grow and can
eventually drive vigorous convection.

The simulations depicted above are very idealized and are only
intended highlight the basic physics of these new forms of convection.
I'm currently working on a method to study the instabilities in a
realistic environment resembling a forming galaxy cluster.  I&lsquo;ve
included a figure from a preliminary simulation below.  This is very
much a work in progres... stay tuned!

<h2 id="sec:ti">Cold Gas in Hot Halos</h2>
<div class="section">

<p>
Remarkably, some galaxy clusters contain thin filaments of cold
(10<sup>4</sup> K) gas embedded right within the hot (10<sup>8</sup>
K) plasma.  Below, the beautiful optical and x-ray images
from <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.418.2154F">Fabian
et al. (2011)</a> show the co-existence of these two phases of gas.

<p>
For part of my Ph.D. thesis, I studied thermal instability in galaxy
clusters and whether it could produce filaments of cold gas like the
ones observed.  Whether or not the plasma in clusters is thermally
unstable is a surprisingly tricky question --- it depends on the
unknown &ldquo;feedback&rdquo; process heating the plasma.  This is
extremely difficult to model in detail and is still a very active
field of research.  My approach was to <i>assume</i> that the gas is
thermally unstable, then to see what other testable implications that
would have for the gas in galaxy clusters.
</p>

<p>
Even though I assumed that all of the plasma in every
cluster <i>is</i> thermally unstable, the non-linear saturation turned
out to have an interesting result: the instability only grows to
large amplitudes at special locations in the cluster.  We should only
expect to see cold gas develop at locations where the cooling time
drops below the free-fall (or dynamical) time.  The plot below shows
this result for various assumptions about the gas.  In all cases, we
only see clumps or filaments of cold gas when the cooling time is
shorter than the free-fall time.
</p>

     alt="hbi nonlinear evolution"
     class="pad top bottom right">
</a>
Though this result depends on the non-linear saturation of the thermal
instability, we got lucky and it&rsquo;s surprisingly simple to
understand.  The plot to the right tracks the growth of the
instability in my simulations.  Perturbations initially grow
exponentially, which is not surprising since I put in an instability
by hand.  (The slower growth for the red curve happens because the
instability switches to an overstability in that limit.)  The
exponential growth can&rsquo;t continue forever, however; it stops
when the damping rate due to internal gravity wave turbulence matches
the driving rate due to thermal instability.  This balance picks out a
final amplitude δρ/ρ~(t<sub>cool</sub>/t<sub>ff</sub>)<sup>-1</sup>.
Multi-phase gas requires δρ/ρ>1, which explains the result above.
</p>

<p>
The figure below plots the ratio t<sub>cool</sub>/t<sub>ff</sub> as a
function of radius in a handful of galaxy clusters.  The ones shown in
blue are clusters which are known to have filaments of cold gas, while
the ones shown in red are known <i>not</i> to contain filaments.
There does seem to be a threshold separating the clusters with and
without multiphase gas.  Interestingly, the curves all reach a minimum
at a few tens of kiloparsecs; this is exactly where we see cold gas
seen in many clusters!

<h2 id="sec:outer-parts"}>Why Aren&rsquo;t Galaxy Clusters Isothermal?</h2>
<div class="section">

<p>
Somehow, galaxy clusters maintain their large-scale temperature
gradients in spite of thermal conduction and convection.  Conduction
and convection are enemies of temperature differences... they should
only take a few billion years to equilibrate and make the gas
isothermal, which is less than the age of a typical cluster.  Since
the convective stability of cluster gas depends on its temperature
profile, I became very interested in understanding what determines
this temperature profile.
</p>

<img src="{{site.url}}/figures/constant-temp-profiles.png"
     alt="hbi nonlinear evolution"
     class="pad top bottom right">
</a>
I put together a simple model for the formation of galaxy clusters in
which the cluster assembles &ldquo;shell-by-shell.&rdquo; Each shell
falls in a little faster than the last, and thus shocks to a higher
entropy.  Hydrostatic equilibrium then determines the temperature
profile, which depends directly on the accretion rate of the cluster.
The accretion rates typical for galaxy clusters turn out to yield
declining temperature profiles, similar to what are observed.
Measuring the properties of the gas in clusters may thus provide an
interesting indirect measurement of the formation histories of
clusters.
</p>

<p>
This model neatly reproduces the observed temperature profiles of
galaxy clusters, but what about conduction and convection?  Why
don&rsquo;t they wash out the temperature differences and make the gas
isothermal?  Conduction does indeed move thermal energy outwards in
galaxy clusters.  But, rather than heating the gas in the outskirts up
to higher temperatures, the influx of thermal energy expands the gas
&mdash; this pushes the shock further out and causes the temperature
to actually go down!
</p>

<p>
This method provides an inexpensive way to model the temperature
profile of a galaxy cluster given its accretion history.  Since the
scatter in accretion histories is well-known from cosmological
simulations of structure formation, I outlined a method for using the
(known) scatter in accretion histories to predict the (unknown)
scatter in cluster observables.  My collaborators and I are currently
using this method to better understand potential biases in some
cosmological measurements.

and it makes for some pretty plots!

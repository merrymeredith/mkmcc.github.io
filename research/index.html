<h2>Do Galaxy Clusters Boil?</h2>

The hot plasma filling galaxy clusters is magnetized and thermally
conductive.  This means this gas is susceptible to two
recently-discovered instabilities known as the HBI and the MTI
(pictured to the left) &mdash; these instabilities are a lot like
normal convection, but they depend on <i>temperature</i> instead
of <i>entropy</i>.  This is very interesting, because the gas in
galaxy clusters is stable to the classical theory for convection, but
unstable to these new instabilities.  So, while clusters have long
been assumed to be convectively stable, it now seems that the
intracluster plasma might boil vigorously.  This boiling represents a
radical change in the dynamics of cluster gas and could affect the way
we interpret a range of observations of galaxy clusters.  For
example, convection efficiently mixes the gas and would distribute
metals more efficiently through the galaxy cluster.  Boiling also
drives turbulence, which influences the connection between gas
pressure and gravity used to infer the masses of clusters.
</p>

<p>
I studied these new forms of convection as part of my Ph.D. thesis; in
particular, I worked on understanding the differences between the HBI
and the MTI and on understanding non-linear saturation of the
convective instabilities.  Since the linear phases are so short-lived,
understanding the non-linear behavior of the instabilities is
essential for knowing their astrophysical implications.
</p>

<p>
The HBI, pictured below, turns out to be a fairly quiescent
instability.  As the instability grows, it reorients magnetic field
lines to be preferentially horizontal.  This <i>stabilizes</i> the gas
against the HBI, so the instability effectively shuts itself off
before it really develops.  We end up with a stable atmosphere,
without much turbulence, and with very horizontal magnetic field
lines.  This happens when the temperature increases with radius, as in
the centers of cool-core galaxy clusters.

<p>
The MTI occurs in the outer parts of galaxy clusters, where the
temperature declines with radius.  In many ways, this instability is
similar to the HBI: it creates buoyant plumes which rake out the
magnetic field lines, reorienting an initially horizontal field to
become predominantly vertical.  This is where the similarity with the
HBI stops, however: while vertical field lines are linearly stable to
the MTI, they are <i>non-linearly unstable</i> (i.e., they become
unstable if given a big enough push).  So the MTI can&rsquo;t shut
itself off as efficiently as the HBI; it continues to grow and can
eventually drive vigorous convection.

The simulations depicted above are very idealized and are only
intended highlight the basic physics of these new forms of convection.
I'm currently working on a method to study the instabilities in a
realistic environment resembling a forming galaxy cluster.  I&lsquo;ve
included a figure from a preliminary simulation below.  This is very
much a work in progres... stay tuned!

I&rsquo;ve also studied thermal instability in galaxy clusters.  Whether
or not the plasma in clusters is thermally unstable is a
surprisingly tricky question --- it depends on the unknown
&ldquo;feedback&rdquo; process heating the plasma.
</p>

<p>
Under the reasonable assumption that the plasma in clusters <i>is</i>
thermally unstable, however, the non-linear saturation turns out to
have an interesting result: the instability can only grow to large
amplitudes at special locations in the cluster.  This location
coincides with the &ldquo;filaments&rdquo; of cold gas seen in many
clusters, and it offers a quantitative explanation of the x-ray
luminosity-temperature relation.

<h2>Structure Formation and Cluster Outskirts</h2>

somehow, clusters maintain their large-scale temperature gradients
in spite of thermal conduction and convection.

<p>
The work described in the poster to the right (and in
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.432..404M">this
paper</a>) argues that the continued formation of clusters actually
generates and maintains this temperature gradient.  Measuring the
properties of the gas in clusters may thus directly constrain for
formation histories of clusters.

The paper also outlines a method for using the (known) scatter in
accretion histories to predict the (unknown) scatter in cluster
observables.  My collaborators and I are currently using this method
to better understand potential biases in some cosmological
measurements.
